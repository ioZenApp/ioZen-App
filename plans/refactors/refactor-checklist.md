---

## Phase 1: Cleanup & Dead Code Removal ⏱️ 2-3 hours

### Dead Route Groups & Files

- [x] ~~Delete `src/components/dashboard/chat-view.tsx`~~ - **KEPT: imported by chatflow-editor.tsx**
- [x] Delete `src/app/api/chatflows/` directory (duplicate)
- [x] Search codebase for any references to `(auth)` routes
- [x] Verify no broken imports

### Root Directory Cleanup

- [x] Run `pnpm lint` - no new errors (Phase 1 scope files fixed)
- [x] Manual test: Login flow works (done by Jay)
- [x] Manual test: Dashboard loads (done by Jay)

---

## Phase 2: Consolidate API Routes ⏱️ 3-4 hours

- [x] Search for imports of `/api/chatflows/generate`
- [x] Update any client code to use `/api/chatflows/`

### Restructure to Plural Naming
- [x] Create new `src/app/api/chatflows/` directory (plural)
- [x] Move `api/chatflow/route.ts` → `api/chatflows/route.ts`
- [x] Move `api/chatflow/[id]/route.ts` → `api/chatflows/[id]/route.ts`
- [x] Move `api/chatflow/[id]/submissions/route.ts` → `api/chatflows/[id]/submissions/route.ts`
- [x] Move `api/chatflow/generate/route.ts` → `api/chatflows/generate/route.ts`

- [x] Test: Edit chatflow
- [x] Test: View submissions
- [x] Test: Publish chatflow (working, but the success page when published is not apearing)
- [x] Test: Submit to public chatflow

**Note:** Skipped API utilities creation - can be added in Phase 5 (Code Patterns)

### API Naming Convention Decision ✅

**Philosophy**: "The way you do small things is the way you do everything."

**Established Standards:**
- ✅ **Plural resource naming** - `/api/chatflows` not `/api/chatflow`
- ✅ **RESTful conventions** - Consistent with industry standards
- ✅ **Pre-launch advantage** - No backward compatibility burden
- ✅ **Clean slate** - Establish correct patterns from the start

**Routes Structure:**
```
GET    /api/chatflows           # List all chatflows
POST   /api/chatflows           # Create new chatflow
GET    /api/chatflows/[id]      # Get one chatflow
PATCH  /api/chatflows/[id]      # Update chatflow
DELETE /api/chatflows/[id]      # Delete chatflow
POST   /api/chatflows/submit    # Submit to chatflow (public)
```

**Public Endpoint Security:**
- `/api/chatflows/submit` - Public access maintained for PUBLISHED chatflows only
- Draft chatflows require authentication and workspace membership
- Security enforced at application layer (Zod + Prisma checks)

## Notes

Use this section to track issues, decisions, or questions during refactor:

```
[2025-11-20] API Route Standardization - RESTful Plural Naming Convention
- Restructured ALL routes from singular (/api/chatflow/*) to plural (/api/chatflows/*)
- Rationale: Pre-launch stage = perfect time to establish clean conventions
- Philosophy: "The way you do small things is the way you do everything"
- No backward compatibility needed (no external users yet)
- Standardized patterns: /api/chatflows, /api/chatflows/[id], /api/chatflows/submit
- Public submit endpoint maintains unauthenticated access for published chatflows
- All internal references updated successfully
- Impact: Zero (no production users, no external integrations)

[2025-11-21] Phase 6 Testing Infrastructure Completed
- Installed Vitest 2.1.0 with React 19 compatible Testing Library
- Created 6 test files with 76 passing tests
- Integrated SOLID testing principles throughout documentation
- Coverage: 100% for utils.ts, 100% for type guards, 90%+ for action-utils, 100% for button, 96% for input
- All builds and type checks passing
- Test execution time: ~1.6 seconds
- Documentation updated across all docs/ files with testing standards
```
